🔐 SEED Security Labs — My Work & Solutions

This repository contains my completed work for the SEED Security Labs, a collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs designed to teach real-world vulnerabilities, exploits, and defenses.
I worked through these labs step-by-step, implementing attacks, analyzing root causes, and documenting mitigations.

📚 About SEED Security Labs

The SEED (Software Engineering Education for Defenses) Labs are widely used in academic security courses to provide practical experience with system and application security.
These labs emphasize learning by doing — working directly with vulnerable code and environments to understand how attacks work in practice.

Topics covered include (but are not limited to):

🧠 Memory vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, format string bugs)

🌐 Web security (SQL injection)

🧩 Operating system & kernel security concepts

📡 Network attacks and protocol weaknesses

🔑 Cryptography and secure communication

🧾 Smart contract vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, access control)

🛡️ Secure coding practices and mitigation techniques

🛠️ What’s in This Repository

This repo contains my personal solutions and notes for the labs, including:

✅ Completed lab exercises

💥 Proof-of-concept exploits and attack scripts

📝 Write-ups explaining:

The vulnerability

How it is exploited

Why it works

How to fix or mitigate it

🧪 Supporting files (test inputs, helper scripts, configs)

Each lab is organized in its own directory.

🔍 How I Approached the Labs

For each lab, my general workflow was:

📖 Read and analyze the lab instructions and source code

🔎 Reproduce the vulnerable behavior in a controlled environment

⚙️ Develop an exploit or attack to demonstrate the issue

🛠️ Apply or describe mitigations and verify they work

✍️ Document findings and steps for reproducibility

My goal was not just to “finish” the labs, but to deeply understand the security concepts behind each vulnerability.

▶️ Running the Labs

Each lab folder may contain its own README or notes with setup instructions.

Most labs require:

A Linux environment (often via VM or container)

Common tools such as gcc, gdb, Python, or Docker

⚠️ Important:
These labs intentionally contain vulnerable code. Always run them in isolated environments (VMs or containers), never on production systems.

💡 Why This Repo Exists

I created this repository to:

Reinforce my understanding of computer security concepts

Keep a structured reference for future review

Demonstrate hands-on experience with real vulnerabilities and defenses
