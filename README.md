# 🔐 SEED Security Labs — My Work & Solutions

This repository contains my completed work for the **SEED Security Labs**, a collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs designed to teach **real-world vulnerabilities, exploits, and defenses**.  
I worked through these labs step-by-step, implementing attacks, analyzing root causes, and documenting mitigations.

## 📚 About SEED Security Labs

The **SEED (Software Engineering Education for Defenses)** Labs are widely used in academic security courses to provide practical experience with system and application security.  
These labs emphasize *learning by doing* — working directly with vulnerable code and environments to understand how attacks work in practice.

### Topics Covered
- 🧠 **Memory vulnerabilities** (buffer overflows, format string bugs)
- 🌐 **Web security** (SQL injection)
- 🧩 **Operating system & kernel security concepts**
- 📡 **Network attacks and protocol weaknesses**
- 🔑 **Cryptography and secure communication**
- 🧾 **Smart contract vulnerabilities** (e.g., reentrancy, access control)
- 🛡️ **Secure coding practices and mitigation techniques**

## 🛠️ What’s in This Repository

This repo contains my **personal solutions and notes** for the labs, including:

- ✅ Completed lab exercises  
- 💥 Proof-of-concept exploits and attack scripts  
- 📝 Write-ups explaining:
  - The vulnerability
  - How it is exploited
  - Why it works
  - How to fix or mitigate it

Each lab is organized in its own directory.

## 🔍 How I Approached the Labs

For each lab, my general workflow was:

1. 📖 Read and analyze the lab instructions and source code  
2. 🔎 Reproduce the vulnerable behavior in a controlled environment  
3. ⚙️ Develop an exploit or attack to demonstrate the issue  
4. 🛠️ Apply or describe mitigations and verify they work  
5. ✍️ Document findings and steps for reproducibility  

My goal was not just to *“finish”* the labs, but to **deeply understand the security concepts** behind each vulnerability.
